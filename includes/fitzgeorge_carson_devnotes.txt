I am not the developer in this project, but my partner (who shall remain unnamed for now, but let's be honest, you probably already know) will be. This is just a placeholder for when they access the Github repo. Everything here is subject to change.

- Maybe the glitter pattern in the mockups could become more and more apparent the further you go into the menus?
